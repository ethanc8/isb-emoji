Bluemoji Free Icon License Agreement

This license agreement (hereinafter referred to as the "Agreement") governs the terms and conditions for the use and distribution of the bluemoji icons (hereinafter referred to as the "Icons") provided by bluemoji.io (hereinafter referred to as the "Licensor"). By downloading, accessing, or using the Icons, you agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

Permitted Use:

‍You are granted the following rights and permissions, provided that you comply with the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement:

    You are allowed to freely share, use, and build upon the Icons for personal or entertaining content without commercial purposes. This includes but is not limited to social media blog posts, memes, personal websites, and non-profit projects.
    You may use the Icons in commercial end products, provided they are incorporated into a larger work alongside other elements, resulting in a distinct and expanded creation.
    You may use the Icons in content that generates revenue for the author, such as YouTube videos or Roblox game assets that are for sale, as long as the presence of the Icons is not solely for commercial reasons. The Icons should be used to enhance the overall content and not as the main selling point. Proper attribution to "bluemoji.io" is required in these cases.
    The Icons may be used as the main selling point for a product, such as a video or game asset, marketing materials, or other forms of content, as long as the primary purpose of the product is for entertainment, user engagement, or brand awareness, and not solely for commercial reasons. This usage is allowed even if it generates minimum or no revenue. Proper attribution to "bluemoji.io" is required in these cases.

Prohibited Use:

‍You are expressly prohibited from engaging in the following activities without obtaining explicit written permission from the Licensor:

    Using the Icons in logos, trademarks, service marks, or any other similar branding elements.
    Using the Icons in commercial products where the bluemoji icon is the main or central part of the product, such as a t-shirt with an emoji print.This refers to situations where a person or company starts to sell a product primarily focused on the bluemoji icon, without similar past experience or outside the established pattern of behavior. For example, if a person or company with no previous history of selling emoji-related products suddenly introduces a product that heavily relies on the bluemoji icon for commercial gain, it would be considered as using the Icons solely for commercial purposes.

Attribution and Credit:

‍Whenever you use the Icons in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, you are required to provide credit to "bluemoji.io" in a visible manner, giving appropriate attribution. This can be in the form of text, a hyperlink, or any other suitable method that clearly acknowledges the source of the Icons.

Ownership and Intellectual Property:

‍All rights, title, and interest in and to the Icons remain the exclusive property of the Licensor. This Agreement does not grant you any ownership or intellectual property rights to the Icons except for the limited rights expressly stated herein.

Corrections to the Agreement:

‍The Licensor reserves the right to make corrections or updates to this Agreement as necessary. Such corrections or updates may be made at any time without prior notice. It is your responsibility to review the most current version of the Agreement periodically. Your continued use of the Icons after any changes or updates to the Agreement constitutes your acceptance of the revised terms.

Disclaimer of Warranty:

‍The Icons are provided on an "as is" basis without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. The Licensor makes no warranties or representations regarding the accuracy, completeness, or reliability of the Icons.

Limitation of Liability:

‍To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall the Licensor be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising out of or in connection with the use or distribution of the Icons, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

Termination:

‍This Agreement is effective until terminated. The Licensor may terminate this Agreement at any time without prior notice if you fail to comply with any of its terms and conditions. Upon termination, you must immediately cease all use and distribution of the Icons and delete all copies in your possession or control.
